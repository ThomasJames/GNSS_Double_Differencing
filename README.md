# ðŸ“¡ GNSS Double Differencing  ðŸ“¡

Double Differencing: Main method of high precision commercial positioning. This method requires two high grade GNSS receivers. In this case a reference, and a (static or kinematic) rover receiver.  

## Scenario

Phase and pseudorange observations measured on a calibration baseline in Valencia, Spain. The sensors used
are geodetic quality Leica receivers using choke ring antennas. The receiver on pillar 1A is treated as
the reference receiver, with the following known ECEF coordinates in metres (XYZ)T
for the phase

centre:
4929635.440
 -29041.877
4033567.846

Use the following nominal coordinates for the phase centre of the sensor on pillar 3A:
4929605.400
 -29123.700
4033603.800

Use double differenced phase measurements, from the first epoch of data only (2016 11 15 22 19
5), to compute the precise coordinates of the pillar 3A sensor phase centre

## Data

The original [text file](https://github.com/ThomasJames/GNSS_Data_(text).txt) is in this repository, however the data has been organised and processed into [python](https://github.com/ThomasJames/GNSS_Double_Differencing/Data.py) variables. 

## Method 

<img src="https://github.com/ThomasJames/GNSS_Double_Differencing/blob/master/Diagrams/Method_Flowchart.png" width="600">

Satellite G24 has the highest elevation of apprixmatley 71 degrees. This satellite is used as the reference satellite.

It is important to initially calculate the elevation angles of each satelite. The error of a satellite is inversely proportial to elevation with respect to a local horizon. Low elevation satellites produce less reliable results, and this needs to be taken into account when formulating a weight matrix.

### Computations of elevations and variances:

This method calculates the satellite angle of elevation in the following stages:                     
Calculates the distance of receiver to the satellite (m) using pythagoras theorem.                   
Calculates the distance between the earth center and the satellite (m) using pythagoras theorem.     
Calculates the distance between the earth center and the receiver (m) using pythagoras theorem.      
These ranges make up a scalene triangle, where all ranges are known.                                 
The low of cosines is used to calculate the angle about the receiver in degrees.                     
90 is subtracted from this angle to get the local elevation angle.                                   
The method then calculates the variance of the satellite at the calculated angle.                    
returns the variance as a float

### b (Observed - Computed)

The observed - computed (b) matrix was calculated in the following steps:

In the code, this has been stored into the variable ``` DD_s_p_a``` This value is expressed in cycles

2. The computed value

3. The observed measurement is subtracted from the computed measurement.
